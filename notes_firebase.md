ðŸ’¡ `Firebase`

In the past, `Firebase` was a database and was not a part of `Google`.

Later, `Firebase` got aquired by Google, M&A, and then got extended by help of Google. You may call `Firebase` as a backend-as-a-Service.

`Firebase` supports backend of applications as well as database.

For example, you made need to write less code at the server-side, which is handled by Firebase, and focus on logics of your application.

`Firebase`'s Authentication service makes application development much easier by delegating the authentication feature to `Firebase`.

This will save the time for the developer to focus on the product development. (Understanding the flow of authentication is recommended)

Competition of `Firebase` is AWS amplify.


ðŸ’¡ When to use `Firebase`?

* Developing and testing MVP products or ideas as soon as possible.

* For real business or serious service, perhaps deploying on different platform may be a good idea.
